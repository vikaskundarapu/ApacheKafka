# ApacheKafka
Overview of Apache Kafka concepts. 
Created two projects:

1) mykafta-practice

The project consists of basic concept of Apache Kafka. We have created a Producer that dumps the data into Apache Kafka. This data is consumed by Consumer


2) twitter-kafka-example

This project picks the data from Twitter stream real time and pushes into Apache Kafka. We use this data using Kafka Consumer and finally land the data into ElasticSearch. We have used Bonsai to implement ElasticSearch.
